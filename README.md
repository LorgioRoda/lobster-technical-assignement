# Project Lobster Technical assignement for a Full Stack developer

## Project Lobster, Technology & You
In Project Lobster we are always looking for curious, professional, and eager to learn developers.
Thanks to you, we can ship more and better value to our end customers, as well as making the best decisions possible from a business point of view.

To us, your previous experience isn't as important as:
- Your attitude in front of new things
- Your eagerness to learn
- Your humility
- Your relationship with co-workers

## Aim of the assignement and how it will be rated
The aim of this assignment is to see how the applicant works with new frameworks to them in a full-stack context: [Adonis](https://adonisjs.com/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/).

It should not last more than two days. And this code will never be used in production, it is purely to understand how the applicant works with the given assignment.

Due to the short time, and expecting that the applicant is not familiarised with frameworks and/or language, the quality or cleanness of code won't be harshly judged. As long as the applicant later on can ask, comment, and defend their decisions. Sharing what could have been done better, and how.

Asking questions about the assignement is okey and encouraged, we will take into account the type of questions and how they are asked.

## Repo instructions
In order to do the assignement in your machine, you will need to have installed at least:
- Node.js 14
- npm >= 6.0.0.

Once you have those installed, you need to follow these steps to boot the project and start with the assignment:
1. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and make your fork private (so other applicants don't copy you!). You shouldn't make any pull request to this repo. This is just so that you can commit your changes to your fork, and then share it with us when you are done.
2. Download the code to your machine
3. Open a terminal inside the folder containing the code
4. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
5. Create an `.env` file in your root folder and copy the contents of the file `.env.example`
6. Run `npm run dev` to process the front-end assets and start the development server. If everything worked well and you visit [localhost:3333](localhost:3333) on your browser: you should see a page with more instructions that starts with "It Works!"
7. Kill the process (or open another terminal, it's the same) and run `node ace repopulate:db` to start a SQLite database, and populate it with some fake order and items. If you don't do this: you might find some errors navigating through the page

## The assignement itself
You will find all the details inside the project, on the welcome screen, once you have started the dev server
